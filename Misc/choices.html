<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
<p>Biometric technolgoics has received a lot of attention as it has improved safely and convenience in comparison to the existing methods for identification including ID card, seal or password.
It is the technology that can cope with the future society. Authentication process in a daily lives including the use of devices and banking businesses. Biometric technology uses unique characteriscs of different body parts including fingerprint, and iris patterns have been actively devlopeld and applied to daily lives. They are being used by governments and private companies in very diverse settings like, social security entitlement, border control, health systems, banking, election management, insurance, and commerce  (Dass & Jain, as cited in Sutrop & Mikko, 2012).</p>
<p> There is a growing need for advanced security sytem and biometrics technology uses various types of information on the body. This technology has been widley used for different areas including the national security of companies, financial services and cultural sector and has provided improved convenience and stability. This helps the modern world and will be very resourceful for us now and the future to come. Biometric as a security measure is ideal for our society, because it is more convenient than passwords or personal identification number because the characteristics cannot be forgotten and are always at hand. Biometics verification system enhance security, fraud reductions, making airports easier for trusted travelers and verifying credit and consumer behaviour (Rosenzweig n.d). 
</p>
<p>According to Andersson (2019) in an interview, the biometric sytem has evolved over the period from 2015 - till now. Mobile industry took up biometrics like fingerprints, overtime iris and face now. This application unlike any biometric are seen in previous years, created a volume of us familiarity in the general population and acceptance of biometry that was not around before.
It is the government way of controlling citizen it has become the citizen's opportunity to manage in an efficient and user-friendly way they need to authenticate to PayPal, Alibaba, Facebook, and others. With that volume of application came experience and with the size of the market came with a willingness to spend immense volumes, resources, experience and money on developing biometrics. Today the face, iris, fingerprint is a way beyond anything you could do with those technologies in 2015. Which is a higher performance on a mobile phone than what could be achieved in a nation ID scheme with large sensors and a database. 
</p>
<p> As the COVID-19 crisis unfolds across the world at a significant pace, organizations are increasingly and rapidly looking for ways to install biometric sensors that avoid touch in shared and public spaces.  As we are in amid of a global pandemic, this virus has forced a behavioural change to society, such as adapting from a physical environment to an online workplace and contactless payments over cash. In the early years, biometric technologies mainly use fingerprints. However along the continuous development of related technooliges different types of biometics that uses iris, voice and face are closely connected with individual users. For foreign visitors, it helps simplify immigration, inspection services and ID cards. Along with the expanded use of smartphone, it has increased the convenience of individuals, so technology has been closely connected with peoples daily lives. The urgent need for contactless solutions has become more of a necessity. Retailers who previously resisted contactless payments have been forced to make the switch and biometric technologies such as facial recognition, which offers a fully contactless experience, are now being considered to solve several issues faced by businesses across a wide range of sectors. Contactless Biometrics involves ‘touchless’ technology for identity verification, access control, payments and transactions, without any physical user interaction. The use of touchless, personal biometric sensors and devices can help reduce spread of the virus. This, personal mobile biometrics solutions can help to deliver reliable authentication while also meeting strict hygiene requirements. These include facial recognition, iris recognition, palm vein recognition, contactless fingerprint technology and voice biometrics. 
</p>
<p>Biometric systems are improving and developing so quickly. The future of biometric security is likely to improve modern method we use today. Potentially making it the easiest way to provide a high level of protection. What seems to be a major opportunity in volume appears to be payment. Payment transactions authenticated by biometrics will make those more fluid, lower the hurdle to perform the transaction. Due to the global pandemic, contactless biometric technologies is preferable to society. This offers a much secure way in terms of hygiene and convenience. For example, many people own an Iphone which provides apple pay, alongside android users. Contactless payment is the technology that powers Apple Pay, Samsung or Google pay. It is a form of payment that doesn’t require you to slide your card. This allows users to  wave or hold their phone over eftpos machine and make a payment (Marang, 2021). </p>
<p> Facial recognition is estimated to be part of the larget market share. This contactless biometics technology is widely impletementd for identity verification and access control. ‘Palm print identification is an alternative to facial recognition technology that is proven to be more accurate and safe in our new contactless world’ (Kontesevich, 2020). Because we’re in the middle of a global pandemic, facial recognition are less accurate as it is potentially harmful if an individual needs to take their mask off to use facial recognition software. This decreases the accuracy of surveillance systems or prevents from unlocking smartphones or the use of face recognition technologies. This biometric system has benefit for financial services. People don’t have to carry their cards or bank book when using an atm machine, can withdraw money without wallet simply by scanning their palms. </p>
<p> According to market and market report states ‘The touchless sensing market is projected to reach USD 15.3 billion in 2025 from USD 6.8 billion in 2020 at a CAGR of 17.4%.’
The market include increasing demand for contact-free sensing as well as hygiene issues and favorable programs deployed by the government. The high demand for touchless biometric solutions, will create more opportunities for the market in the future. There will be a high cost range in touchless sensing products which will cause a challenge for the market. 
</p>
<h2>Touchless Sensing Market By Industry:</h2>
	<li>Consumer Electronics</li>
	<li>Government</li>
	<li>Finance & Banking</li>
	<li>Healthcare</li>
	<li>Automotive</li>
	<li>Others (Retail & Hospitality)</li>
<p>In conclusion, new opportunities for existing biometrics to be adapted regarding to COVID-19, or where biometrics technology itself has potential to help in the fight against the virus. The biometics technology we have today enables identification through a certain type of action with a device, in both direct and indirect ways. </p>
