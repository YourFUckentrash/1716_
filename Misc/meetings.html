<h2>Meeting 1 </h2>
<p> Discussion/research about Biometrics. </p>
<p>4th may 2021</p>
<h2>Meeting 2 </h2>
<p> Discussion/research about opportunities Biometrics. </p>
<p>specific forms of biometrics aren't possible to use in certain places. For example it is not suitable for people working in the chemical industries. Another disadvantage is that biometric technology does not have 100% success rate yet and can result in false positives and negatives, this means that humans undergo changes throughout their life, for example the human voice changes as we age, or it differs if weâ€™re sick, e.g having sore throat or a cold. And therefore this leads to a difficult time to identify the person by their voice as when they are ill it can be extremely challenging for biometrics to keep it a 100% accuracy.</p>

<h2>Meeting 3 </h2>
<p> Discussion/research about Risks of Biometrics. </p>
<p> combined protection of a physical and signatures with other authentication like biometrics will give some of the strongest known securities currently at this moment in time plus it is much better to use biometrics than using a character-based password as a main means of verification. Biometric technology is very compelling when it comes to security. Despite its risks, the systems are very convenient for us and hard to duplicate. Plus looking ahead in the future these systems will continue to develop for a very long time.</p>

<h2>Meeting 4 </h2>
<p> Discussion/research about Choices of Biometrics. </p>
<p> new opportunities for existing biometrics to be adapted regarding to COVID-19, or where biometrics technology itself has potential to help in the fight against the virus. The biometics technology we have today enables identification through a certain type of action with a device, in both direct and indirect ways.</p>
<p>14th may 2021</p>
<h2>Meeting 5 </h2>
<p> Finializing the website and information of Biometrics. </p>
<p> Making sure infomration is all backed up, references are in place and we all are wokring well and coping with the tasks we were given and not struggling.
