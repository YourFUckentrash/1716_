<h1>Advantages Of Biometrics</h1>
<p>Biometrics seems like a good choice, it still has major drawbacks. For example specific forms of biometrics aren't possible to use in certain places. For example it is not suitable for people working in the chemical 
industries. Another disadvantage is that biometric technology does not have 100% success rate yet and can result in false positives and negatives, this means that humans undergo changes throughout their life, for 
example the human voice changes as we age, or it differs if we’re sick, e.g having sore throat or a cold. And therefore this leads to a difficult time to identify the person by their voice as when they are ill it can 
be extremely challenging for biometrics to keep it a 100% accuracy.</p>
</ul>
<h2>List of advantages of Biometrics</h2>
<li>As said multiple times, one of the main benefits of using biometrics is its ability to accurately identify individuals. Biometrics mainly relies on using fingerprints, an iris pattern or facial characteristics. 
Superior accuracy is the main reason why a lot of companies use biometrics for their security purposes.</li>
<!-- please put images in here idk why but just do it -->
<li>Biometrics has already been used in a lot of industries, this includes healthcare, businesses, school, financial industries and also for gaming. A lot of countries have even considered and are using biometrics as 
a means for voter registration, national ID, and national healthcare or e-passport projects.</li>
<li>With the current flourishing of internet based businesses and also the increased requirement for safe and accurate verification when accessing your account, biometric technology proves to be the best option and 
the most suitable means for secure mobile transaction identification.</li>
<li> Another advantage of biometrics is it is very cost-effective in the long run, in terms of short-term investments making use of biometrics may cost a lot of money, but looking at it in the long run, it will be much
 much more cost-effective as companies don’t need to use or keep making ID cards for new employees as these employees can just easily use their own biological data to access systems and buildings</li>
<li>The user experience is very convenient and fast, with just a read of your fingerprint you can easily log on.</li>
<li>Biometrics is non-transferrable, what this means, everyone has access to a unique set of biometrics and so this makes it very secure.</li>
<li>Biometrics are really hard to fake or steal.</li>
<li>It is very reliable, as said before due to it’s unforgettable, non-transferrable and robust security features, it increases the reliability of human identification.</li>
<li>In a workplace scenario, where it is hard to keep track of each and one of the employees' attendance, this is where biometrics shine. Biometrics technology keeps track of the time and attendance of each employee. As it is almost impossible to fake your attendance with biometrics technology.</li>
