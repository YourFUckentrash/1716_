		<td> <em>Biometrics is a new and growing technology, it has a very huge potential. Biometrics offers a new level of security which requires unique data that is very hard or close to impossible to forge. Another point to consider here is that with this technology it is no longer required to use ID or passwords. And therefore this will result in less fraud incidents and unauthorised use of such identities and passwords. Biometrics is being implemented all over the world, and its usage keeps increasing over time. A common example as stated before is the police that keeps a record of fingerprints of previous criminals to help identify cases in the future. And so to conclude this Biometrics will have so many opportunities in the future especially with the current pandemic of covid-19 I believe that biometrics will help in keeping track of people that have the infection or not. Biometrics is still growing, and it will be that way for a long time, until we can perfectly utilize this technology everywhere we go. Biometric technology will be seen more in the days to come.</em></td>
