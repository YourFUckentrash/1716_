<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
<p> Most people use biometrics verification in their everyday lives. A common example of this would be just simply opening your phone, but in a workplace or a place where there are more people an example of this would be at the airport, to get whisked through long security lines or at the doctor’s office to ensure confidentiality of medical records. In modern times, biometric authentication and verification is essential to the modern technology, and is widespread in more ways than modern users of it fully understand.
</p>
<p> Most common biometric devices and the verification applications today require physiological biometrics, for example, face recognition and thumbprints to unlock phones, laptops etc. But of course they’re not the only key. There’s a whole wide range of biometric uses that are ‘physical’ an example of this would be iris or palm shape. There is also a growing acceptance of behavioral biometrics. For example, the ways that you navigate to specific pages or websites on the internet. How you click on it, whether it’s a phone or your laptop. 
</p>
<p>While biometrics are being used everywhere, especially in this modern age, questions arise on the safety and privacy from the users who are supplying biometric inputs to businesses and governments. People are starting to think, Why does a business need to know what browser I use? What happens if my biometric data is compromised?
</p>

<p>What are the disadvantages of having biometrics as a security measure? While biometrics have been faced with document fraud, identity theft, terrorism and cybercrime, new biometric security solutions are being implemented.
</p>
<h3> Disadvantages of using biometrics?</h3>
<li> Despite having increased security, efficiency and convenience, it does come with a hefty price. A significant investment is required for biometrics to ensure that it is secure. </li>
<li>Data breach. It is still possible to hack and steal people’s info. Especially when businesses and the government collect and store users’ personal info, they are in constant threat from hackers. That’s why organizations need to treat sensitive biometric data with increased security and caution.</li>
<p>Businesses that are transitioning to implement biometric authentication need expert help to prevent the personal identifiers of their customers and employees from becoming compromised. With so much at risk, a business needs a solid contingency plan, plus a solid and accurate understanding of potential risks and vulnerabilities are needed to preserve the privacy and integrity of personal data.
</p>
<p> There have been instances before where the phone can be opened by children or twins. Where physical access to the device is possible, malicious users may modify the sensor to authenticate it. In the case of access to the database, the confidentiality and the integrity of the data in particular are compromised. By reading unencrypted data also means they have access to personal data. Similarly, the attacker can read the data, access the templates and add his or her own information, or they can change the data for the benefit of someone else. By altering these, the link between identity and biometric, it can lead to an inability to authenticate.
</p>
<p>Any incorrect information to be entered at a time of registration may result in misuse or may be matched with an accurate biometric, false identification. Despite these attacks, the first and foremost important security measure is to ensure the physical security of the system. At the same time, the information in the database must be stored or encrypted.
</p>
<p>The central issue is that biometric authentication technologies pose privacy and security concerns; once the biometric data has been compromised, there is absolutely no way to undo the damage. For example if your password is compromised, you simply change it; for a fingerprint, ear image, or iris scan however, you’re stuck with the compromised biometric. You can, in some instances change the biometric used, but take note those are limited too. Biometric identifiers link the person to the system or activity in an explicit way. Those are completely fine when unlocking your mobile device with a fingerprint or a facial scanner, but there are other linkages that individuals will not find comfortable; for example if you used your credit card or debit transactions, your purchase history is uniquely tied to you.
</p>
<p> In summary, biometrics as a whole is still growing as a means to verify identity for cybersecurity systems. Biometrics make a good replacement for usernames, especially when it is pretty common to forget your own password, and it is in fact a very good strategy to use it as a part of your two-factor authenticator as it adds more security on your account. In my opinion the combined protection of a physical and signatures with other authentication like biometrics will give some of the strongest known securities currently at this moment in time plus it is much better to use biometrics than using a character-based password as a main means of verification. Biometric technology is very compelling when it comes to security. Despite its risks, the systems are very convenient for us and hard to duplicate. Plus looking ahead in the future these systems will continue to develop for a very long time.
