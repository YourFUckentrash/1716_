<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Ethical Issues with biometrics do not lead as a major factor. As there have not been many 
reports Ethical Issues to biometrics but there are a some.<br> Such as Privacy this is very 
important, and we think, or society would like to believe that with biometrics it would be 
impossible for other people to access <br>our data. That has turned out not to be the case as there 
are errors sometimes family member who have very similar facial distinction. And there are also<br> 
accessible problems such as if someone for example ahead gotten into an accident and lost and eye, 
facial features were changed due to accidents thus they<br> no longer have access to there data. 
The system is not perfect, but I believe within time the system will improve and achieve greater 
things then it already has. </p>
<p>I have loved this topic I have done as a group with my peers and could not have had asked for 
a better team. We have discussed shared our ideas, our dislikes<br> and likes to the topic and we respect and 
agree to our views of biometrics my views may differ a little but not a lot. I believe biometrics will be a 
norm soon enough.<br> I believe that pins passwords will one day be of the past as how driving a vehicle that uses 
diesel are now next to uncommon and in the past. Biometrics will<br> be a revolutionary way to access houses data the 
keylocks will no longer be necessary as new keylocks are invented that are impossible to picklock as it will be<br> 
biometrics instead the world is moving forward at an incredible pace. From the time span of 2000 to 2010 the world
jump centuries and from 2010 till now the world<br> once again jumped centuries in technology and will only continue to do so.</p>
<p>I would love to recommend everyone to use biometrics Its safer more convenient impossible to forget your password 
and it sure will not be able to be easily hacked<br> like a 4-digit pin. Its an amazing way for users to get access to there data. 
They would not have to type no 40digit password out which would take a while.<br> Its simple a way to move forward in technology.</p>
