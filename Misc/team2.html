<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p> While it is evident that biometrics has had a big impact on the perception and the ‘digital’ manipulation on human identity, I think it resulted in having broad ethical implications regarding the ethical principles and values on how people shape their lives. While biometrics can solve people’s social problems but I think it can also be used to manipulate people. These peculiarities give rise to different degrees of individual and social sensitiveness regarding to what is acceptable these days. While people in our society might agree on some of the abstract principles and values, on the other hand some people might disagree with regard to the understanding of a particular technology in a specific context or use of them as related to such values and principles.

In my opinion, having biometrics in our daily lives as of now, in 2021, it has been a great help in our day to day lives especially when it comes to using it in the workplace or in universities, it’s become easier to track who’s going in and out. While I agree there’s still some flaws in it, with the combination of using passwords plus biometrics, It has a very good sense of security in the workplace. While biometrics concern social and ethical issues such as transparency, communication, efficiency and effectiveness of social transactions, even though it is evident that more and more companies, businesses and even governments having been using biometrics now these days, of course there will still be that slight chance of hacking and spoofing people’s data. But in the upcoming years, especially with the current growth of our technology I personally think that biometrics will become our main source of entry and identification.

I would personally recommend using biometrics but only if you know the risks you need to take into account, for example, which kind of biometric would be the best for your business, which biometric hardware you’re going to use especially with the rapid innovations currently in biometric technology. Also to reduce the risk of sensitive personal information falling into the wrong hands, it is recommended to know that biometric matching only matches the biometric data without requesting the personal data linked to the biometric data. 

But if we’re only talking about simple access such as using our mobile devices, laptops and such. It is highly recommended that you take advantage of it, as it saves a lot of time and also provides us with really good security. Using a fingerprint to unlock a phone or laptop will help you so much in the long run, for example if you forgot your pattern or the password to your mobile device, with biometrics this won’t be an issue anymore.
