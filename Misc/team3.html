<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<p>Privacy is an ethical issue relating to biometrics as a security measure. Data that has been stored about individuals, essentially all these information systems are backed up by database and people sign up to this system to use and they give their information. When we give personal information to the system, we trust them to use the information correctly. Although data is stored in a business system, does not mean everyone who works for the business should be able to access the data. It does not mean that the business has the right to freely distribute the data. Businesses have the ethical responsibility to maintain the privacy of individuals of whom they have information stored about within their systems. As data is valuable it becomes a target for hackers especially stored information for larger organisations. Hackers may target for the purposes of identity theft, want to use people’s details. Another reason is to obtain banking details, pretending to be another person to access their details systems. 
However, as organisations are responsible for information on their system, in terms for security measures such as user verification methods (login/ password) are implemented to protect information. These information systems have security methods in place to protect individual’s data. It is often a safe place to keep our data which could be safer than our personal computers which could contain viruses and can lose data. Good information system will give you different access of rights. Limiting who can see the data within the system. 
Biometrics has become a huge impact in our everyday lives. Especially with covid-19 pandemic, biometrics has rapidly become more useful and convenient in terms of mobile payment. People are more encouraged to use payWave, apple pay, Samsung pay so they don’t have to touch the eftpos machine. This service confirms payment by simply placing their finger on their phone or face recognition. With future biometric authentication devices will enhance worker safety and slow the spread of the virus. Biometrics in general is a better way and more efficient way to verify a person’s identity and access security. 
As biometrics authentication is rapidly evolving technology, it has become a highly favoured security measure among today’s top companies and organizations. People can make use of many varieties of biometric measures including face, retinal, fingerprint, voice recognition and many more. Biometrics is the replacement for passwords because they are generally more secure. Therefore, people are more encouraged to use this as a security measure.  However, this technology is classified as a personal data, which is still largely unprotected. With more development in the future, this could build privacy protections into systems.
